Velocity: Include an Editable Contentlet
==================================

This veloctiy macro is intended for dotCMS. The macro includes a contentlet with an easy to edit button for content editors effectively creating an editable region/WYSIWYG. 

Please note that in order to use this code, you must replace the "###-####-####" with your actual content host's ID. Once the code is updated you just need to include the code, then call the function like so:

    #printContent( 'Awesome Sidebar Content' )##

Happy coding :-P
